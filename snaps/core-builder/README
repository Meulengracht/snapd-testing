This snap triggers a build of the official Ubuntu Core snap package at:

https://code.launchpad.net/~snappy-dev/+snap/ubuntu-core

If you have a personal branch of lp:ubuntu-core-snap (using your own PPAs
during build for injecting test packages etc...), then please adjust the
variables at the top of lp-build-ubuntu-core to match your needed targets.
(do not forget to fix the mail receipients too)

NOTE: you need to run the builder script at least once by hand to have launchpad
      create the necessary credentials for automated execution.
